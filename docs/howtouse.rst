===================================

.. warning::
    Do not put any secrets, passwords or any sensitive information in this documentation as it maybe publicly viewable!

A few technical notes:
  - This documentation is generated by `Sphynx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_
  - The syntax must be written in `reStructuredText <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html>`_
  - The html auto updates as you make changes while developing locally with docker.
  - The docker-compose.yml has 2 containers - sphynx (which watches your changes and updates the html) and nginx (which
    serves the generated html on `localhost:9876 <http://localhost:9876>`_


Getting Started
---------------------

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the root directory in your terminal and execute `docker-compose up -d` to start Sphynx.  Open your browser
   to `localhost:9876 <http://localhost:9876>`_ to see your local version
3. Make changes to one of the ``.rst`` files found under the ``/docs`` directory, sphynx will update the html.  Reload
   the page to see your new changes.

Every page has a link in the upper right "Edit on GitHub" which will link you to the source in the repo.

``/docs/index.rst`` contains the list of .rst templates that the documentation will watch for changes.
